        "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take? Options: (A) Disclose the error to the patient but leave it out of the operative report (B) Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report (C) Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake (E) Refuse to dictate the operative report (D) Report the physician to the ethics committee",

            "0.0": "The correct answer is: **(B) Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report.**\n\nIn medical practice, transparency and honesty are crucial, especially when it comes to complications that occur during procedures. The resident has an ethical obligation to disclose the error to the patient, regardless of the attending physician's opinion. Additionally, documenting the complication in the operative report is important for maintaining accurate medical records and ensuring continuity of care. This approach upholds the principles of patient autonomy and informed consent, allowing the patient to be fully aware of their medical situation."

        "question": "A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions? Options: (D) Generation of free radicals (C) Hyperstabilization of microtubules (B) Inhibition of proteasome (A) Inhibition of thymidine synthesis (E) Cross-linking of DNA",

            "0.0": "The patient's symptoms of sensorineural hearing loss following chemotherapy suggest that he may have been treated with a drug that is known to cause ototoxicity. In the context of chemotherapy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, one of the common agents used is cisplatin, which is known to cause hearing loss due to its ototoxic effects.\n\nCisplatin works primarily by cross-linking DNA, which leads to the generation of DNA damage and ultimately triggers apoptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to:\n\n**Answer: (E) Cross-linking of DNA**"

        "question": "Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet.

The laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal impairment, and the renal biopsy reveals intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles. \n\nGiven the context of recent cardiac catheterization and the presence of eosinophilia (11%), the most fitting diagnosis is **cholesterol embolization** (Option C). This condition can occur after vascular procedures and is characterized by the presence of cholesterol crystals in the renal vasculature, leading to acute kidney injury and systemic symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the medical query is:\n\nAnswer: C) Cholesterol embolization"
